Only use advanced input when you need to capture more detailed information.</li><li>Stay focused on the game: Watch each play carefully and process what you've seen before inputting. Don't get distracted by the app - keep your eyes on the court.</li><li>Use the color-coding to your advantage: Player buttons, action types, and results are color-coded for quick identification. Train your eye to recognize these colors for faster input.</li><li>Record events immediately: Input each event as soon as the play ends. Don't wait to record multiple events at once, as this can lead to errors.</li></ul>",
